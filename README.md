# ITransition-Task-4
## Overview
This project is a responsive web application that provides a complete CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) interface for managing users. In addition to standard user management, the app features authentication and role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure that only authorized users can access and manipulate specific parts of the system.

The frontend is developed using React, TypeScript, Vite, and Tailwind CSS, and connects to a backend API to perform all operations related to users and permissions.
